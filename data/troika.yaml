    name: Ardent Giant of Corda
    desc: >-
      Every giant has a different story about Corda, well told and interrupted
      with tears and laughter, of how they lost it and mean to find it soon
      enough but oh, what of today? We should drink and cheer, we’ll search once
      again in the morning!

    name: Befouler of Ponds
    desc: >-
      You’re a wise man, a high priest, a pond-pisser, a typical but committed
      adherent of P!P!Ssshrp. The bloated Toad God has no church other than the
      periphery of ponds where the foulness catches in the reeds and no
      congregation other than the gnats and dragonflies. You minister to them
      all the same.
    special: You never contract disease as a result of drinking stagnant liquids.
    items:
      - >-

    name: Burglar
    desc: >-
      As a second-story man you often have cause to wander. Enemies come
      naturally from both sides of the law and it pays to keep ahead of trouble.
    special: >-
      You may Test your Luck to find and get in with the local criminal
      underbelly if one exists.

    name: Cacogen
    desc: >-
      You are Those-Filthy-Born, spawned in the hump-backed sky lit only by
      great black anti-suns and false light. Your mother was sailing on the
      golden barges or caught in some more abstract fate when she passed you,
      far from the protective malaise of the million spheres. You were receptive
      to the power and the glory at a generative time and it shows in your
      teratoid form.

    name: Chaos Champion
    desc: >-
      You no longer don the spiked brass armour but you still have the ear of
      your Chaos patron. They’re happy for you to experiment with not plunging
      your world into disorder and, ultimately, darkness, but the door is always
      open.
    special: >-
      Name your patron. You may call upon your patron for aid once per day. To
      do so roll three 6s on `3d6`. The GM will interpret their intervention.
    items:
      - ritual scars
      - a huge maul

    name: Claviger
    desc: >-
      The Key Masters wander the universe fathoming the workings of all
      entryways. Though they’re quite fascinated with simple chests and doors
      they are most excited by metaphysical and metaphorical barriers. You might
      find small conclaves of Clavigers camped around the feet of Demon Gates,
      debating appropriate methods of attack, or building obscure machines of
      entry.
    items:
      - Festooned with Keys (counts as Modest Armour)
      - a distinguished Sledgehammer (Damage as Maul)
      - lock picking tools

    name: Demon Stalker
    desc: >-
      You stake your reputation upon your ability to hunt and kill demonic
      creatures and those who break bread with them. Goat men in the wilds or
      the Angel cults of the slums, all need to be driven back off the edge of
      the map and onto the shores of chaos.
    items:
      - a Silver Sword
      - a longbow
      - 16 silver arrows

      - 3 Blood Shroud
  - id: 22
    name: Dwarf
    desc: >-
      You are a short, hairy, belligerent, alcohol dependent creature. The
      latter two may be linked but you’ll fight anyone who suggests as much.
      Since there are no Dwarf women (or men, technically) there are no Dwarf
      children or Dwarf families so you can fully commit yourself to the
      important Dwarfy endeavours of creating fine art in unusual places. You
      intend to find the most unusual places ever seen in all the million
      spheres.
    special:
      - >-
        Dwarfs may eat gems and rare metals as food replacements. You, in fact,
        vastly prefer the taste of rare minerals to mundane food.
      - >-
        Dwarfs are genderless. You are immune to all compulsions that play on a
        creature’s desire for sex. This also means you don’t have sexual organs.
        Instead of urinating you excrete through sweating, thus explaining your
        odour.

  - id: 23
    name: Epopt
    Desc: >-
      You are a roaming seer, selling your visions at courts and fetes. You are
      instantly recognisable by your yellow coif and habit as being open for
      business. Road weary and worldwise, your unpopular visions cause you to
      constantly move on.
    special: >-
      Epopts may Test their Luck to get a yes or no answer to a question about
      mundane matters. The GM should make this Test in private, not informing
      the Epopt if their visions are accurate.
    items:
      - >-
        yellow epopt outfit, padded for protection against unhappy clients
        (counts as Modest Armour).

    name: Exotic Warrior
    desc: >-
      No one has heard of your homeland. Your habits are peculiar, your clothes
      are outrageous, and in a land jaded to the outlandish and new you still
      somehow manage to stand out.
    items:
      - a weird & wonderful weapon
      - strange clothes
      - exciting accent

    name: The Fellowship of Knidos
    desc: >-
      Mathmologists honour the clean and unambiguous truths of mathematics and
      coordinate them with their observations of the multiverse. All things can
      be measured and predicted with the application of the correct
      mathmological ratios, those methods applied to penetrate the ethereal
      surface and glimpse the fundamental numbers below.

  - id: 26
    name: Fellow of the Peerage of Porters & Basin Fillers
    desc: >-
      Luggers are a servile group by nature, most often found in the service of
      others, weighed down by loads that would buckle a donkey. You take pride
      in this, so much so that the everyday assignments of the guild cannot sate
      your desire to serve, causing you to venture out in search of a real
      challenge for such a talented varlet.
    items:
      - A wooden yoke
      - Brown overcoat
      - Soft doffing cap of the guild
      - A bale hook (Damage as Knife and +1 on rolls to lift heavy objects)

    name: Gremlin Catcher
    desc: >-
      No matter what country, sphere, or abstract dimension you may find
      yourself in, be assured that gremlins will be there digging their warrens
      and bothering nice people willing to pay you a shiny penny to bash their
      little heads in.
    items:
      - Small but vicious dog
      - Flat cap
      - A club

    name: Journeyman of the Guild of Sharp Corners
    desc: >-
      You are an assassin in training, graduated from fighting dummies and
      branding practise clients, freshly imbued with a license to ply your
      trade. You haven’t fully developed the idiosyncratic methods required of a
      master but you are on the path.
    items:
      - Black clothes of the apprentice
      - Garrotte
      - Curved sword

      You are a mercenary retained in the exclusive service of the Phoenix
      Throne, handsomely paid and sent to distant spheres on golden ships to
      spread the ineffable glory of your lords at the tip of your flaming sword.
    items:
      - Exquisite Pistolet
      - Bandolier with 18 Plasmic Cores
      - Greatsword
      - >-
        Brightly coloured clothing with lots of tassels and bells (impossible to
        sneak). Though frivolous looking it is in fact built with the Autarch’s
        divine alchemy and considered Modest Armour while weighing the same as
        normal clothing (takes no slots in your inventory).
    skills:
      - 2 Greatsword Fighting

    name: Lonesome Monarch
    desc: >-
      You were the ruler of all you surveyed, a great conqueror, a lawbringer!
      Unfortunately your horse sped off into the pixie forest, or the court
      magician ensured you disappeared, or you led a sortie into the stars to
      put your stamp on them as well. Either way you are now a lost and lonely
      sovereign without a kingdom—no one has heard of you or your people. Most
      don’t believe you and laugh, or worse, they do believe you and shrug at
      the vagaries of fate.
    items:
      - Nice Weapon of your choice
      - Crown
      - Tired horse
    skills:
      - 3 Etiquette

    name: Member of Miss Kinsey's Dining Club
    desc: >-
      The Eaters know that there are only two worlds: the Without and the
      Within. They intend to insert as much of the prior into the latter as they
      can while experiencing the finest delights available. All culinary
      experience is open to them as nothing is forbidden at Miss Kinsey’s. Try
      the other, other, other white meat.
    special: >-
      Eaters are immune to mundane ingested poisons. They may also identify any
      object if eaten, gaining knowledge of its material, its origin (if
      plausibly familiar), and its magical properties on a successful Test of
      Gastrology though the object must be thoroughly masticated, not merely
      swallowed and passed. This does not grant special immunity to any effects
      the object may possess.
    items:
      - Choose one
        - >-
          Sharp Metal Dentures (damage as Sword)

          cleanly strip all the flesh from one small appendage)

          Blunt Metal Dentures (Damage as Knife. May be used to eat hard
          objects)

    name: Monkeymonger
    desc: >-
      Life on The Wall is hard. One is never more than a few yards from an
      endless fall yet those precarious villages still need to eat. This is
      where you come in with your Edible Monkeys (the distinction is purely for
      appeal since all monkeys are of course edible). You used to spend days on
      end dangling your feet off the edge of the world, watching over your
      chittering livestock while they scampered hither and thither, but there
      was no future in monkey meat. You wanted much more and so stepped off. Or
      you fell off. Either way you and some unlucky monkeys are here now and
      that’s all that matters.
    items:
      - Monkey Club
      - Butcher’s Knife
      - >-
        1d6 small monkeys that do not heed commands but are too scared and
        hungry to travel far from you
      - a pocket full of monkey treats
    skills:
      - 4 Climb
      - 2 Trapping
      - 1 Club Fighting

      The GM may choose to roll on this table anytime the Mien of monkeys must
      be determined.

      - Playful
      - Stalking
      - Hungry
      - Tired
      - Austere
      - Aggressive
  - id: 41
    name: Necromancer
    desc: >-
      The least popular of magical practitioners, Necromancers are shunned by
      the major centres of learning, left to their own devices on the edges of
      society, passing on knowledge in the time honoured master–student dynamic.
      This loneliness encourages students to make their own friends.
    items:
      - Dusty Robes

        - The skull of your Master

    name: Parchment Witch
    desc: >-
      Known for their smooth skin, midnight gatherings, and preternatural fear
      of rain and open flames; the Parchment Witches are long-dead sorcerers who
      cannot give up the vanity of life. They cover themselves in perfect paper
      skin, a patiently painted and immaculately folded imitation of life
      intended to hide ancient bone and gristle.
    special: >-
      You are undead and so do not need to breathe or circulate blood. You take
      double Damage from Silver Weapons and regain Stamina half as effectively
      from all sources. You must Test your Luck if outside in the rain, are made
      wet, are close to open flames, or suffer generally grievous wounds. A
      failure will see your skin ruined. If your skin is compromised you are
      very obviously a walking corpse.
    items:
      - 1d6 Rolls of Parchment
      - Vials of Pigments and Powders

    name: Poorly Made Dwarf
    desc: >-
      Dwarfs are known for being the finest artisans of the million spheres.
      Give a Dwarf a rock and they will make gold, give a Dwarf a boulder and
      they will make a Dwarf. You were supposed to be the finest expression of
      Dwarfy craftsmanship, a true masterpiece, a brand new Dwarf like those
      made by the old masters, but you were deemed imperfect and abandoned.
    special:
      - >-
        Dwarfs may eat gems and rare metals as food replacements. You, in fact,
        vastly prefer the taste of rare minerals to mundane food.
      - >-
        Dwarfs are genderless. You are immune to all compulsions that play on a
        creature’s desire for sex. This also means you don’t have sexual organs.
        Instead of urinating you excrete through sweating, thus explaining your
        odour.
      - >-
        Other Dwarfs will completely ignore you as though you were a piece of
        furniture or somebody’s abandoned hat. Very occasionally they may openly
        examine and comment thoughtfully to themselves on your unforgivable
        flaws, possibly while marking areas for improvement on your body with a
        grease pen. To non-Dwarfy eyes you probably look like any other Dwarf.
        You have +4 Sneak versus Dwarfs.
    items:
      - Woodman's Axe
      - Empty Firkin

    name: Questing Knight
    desc: >-
      You are on a quest for the grail, or the sword, or the throne, or for god,
      or a lost love, or some other significant object. Your sort are common
      enough, wandering the worlds, acting out your romantic melodrama, accusing
      good folk of being demons or faeries. Questing Knights are generally
      considered to be harmless.

      You are an evangelist of the Red Redemption, wandering confessor,
      cauterizer of the festering wound of sin—the constant accumulation and

    name: Rhino-Man
    desc: >-
      The original Rhino-Men were created by an insane sorcerer several
      centuries ago but rebelled and killed him. They are fairly rare creatures,

    desc: >-
      With the body of a bull, the head of a man, the forelegs of a cat, and the
      wings of a swan you are the sweetest of the children of the gods. You,
      however, were not content to rest on your cloud and instead descended from
      the heavens or crawled up from the abyss and set about finding your own
      path among the stars.

    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      Cause a subject to be fixed in place. While they are so held they do not
      move, breathe, fall, perspire, acquire, or otherwise change. They are
      totally immune to harm, in fact. Lasts for 3 minutes.
  - name: Amity
    cost: 4
    desc: >-
      The College of Friends always sends out its Factotums on nights after
      Amity classes. Clearing out the bars and brothels of their drunken
      apprentices is tiring work. Use of this Spell causes the target to Test
      their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or become very friendly towards the
      wizard, as though they were an old friend. They will not act irrationally,
      though, and if they were already a bit of a boor this might not change
      much.
  - name: Animate
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Cause inanimate objects to question their place. One object up to the size
      of a human baby may be caused to hop around and do whatever else the
      wizard wishes.
  - name: Assassin’s Dagger
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      Evocatively named but actually quite mundane. The wizard whispers to an
      object and that object then seeks out and vigorously and repeatedly bumps
      into the desired target. Obviously if you whisper to a poisoned dagger the
      result is one thing while doing it to a letter is another. Travels any
      distance and always arrives (eventually).
  - name: Assume Shape
    cost: 4
    desc: >-
      The wizard undergoes a distressing transformation into an inanimate object
      no larger than a piano and no smaller than a cup. Lasts until ended.
  - name: Astral Reach
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The Sorcerers of the Academy of Doors are most famous for this one Spell.
      With it they may reach through any portal and into another known
      receptacle. For example they might use it to reach through to a safe in
      their manse via their purse. This Spell only allows partial translocation—
      the wizard cannot fully or permanently enter.
  - name: Babble
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      The wizard speaks nonsense while watching the intended target, causing
      their words to trip and confuse. This may be done under their breath and
      relatively subtly.
  - name: Banish Spirit
    cost: 6
    desc: >-
      The wizard explains, clearly, sternly, why it is impossible that the
      spirit could be here at this time. The spirit must Test its Luck (or Skill
      for Enemies) or be sent to somewhere less improbable.
  - name: Befuddle
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      A wizard’s touch can shake up someone’s mind like a snow globe. The target
      makes all rolls at a -1 penalty until their head clears. Lasts for 3
      minutes.
  - name: Blood Shroud
    cost: 4
    desc: >-
      Smear a small amount of a demon’s blood on yourself to become completely
      invisible to them, even if you attack or speak to them, for 6 hours.
  - name: Breach
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      The wizard’s hands work elemental material as though it were soft clay.
      Fire, stone, goo, earth, fog, all of it behaves like clay under their
      touch. Lasts for 9 minutes.
  - name: Brittle Twigs
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      You snap a twig or other brittle object to cause an injury in another.
      They must Test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or suffer a broken bone.
  - name: Callous Strike
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The Wizard-Knights are most famous for their remote combat whereby they
      swing their Silver Swords seemingly at nothing only for their opponents,
      many metres away, to be torn to tatters. This Spell can be used in place
      of a melee attack by Rolling Versus as normal and inflicting Damage
      according to the Weapon used. May only be used against targets within
      clear sight.
  - name: Coal Resolve
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      This Spell turns one’s heart into a burning ember of grief. Those under
      its effect are so consumed by grief that they are immune to mind
      controlling effects and the non-physical impact of pain. Lasts until the
      next rest.
  - name: Cockroach
    cost: 5
    desc: >-
      A popular Spell that turns troublesome folk into humiliated animals. The
      target must Test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or be turned into an
      insignificant creature of the wizard’s choice. Lasts forever.
  - name: Cone of Air
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Creates a mysterious and specifically shaped cone of air focused on a
      touched target’s head. They may continue to breathe the freshest of air
      for 12 minutes.
  - name: Darkness
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      Summon a stationary, perfect sphere of darkness up to five metres from the
      wizard for up to 3 minutes.
  - name: Darksee
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The wizard reaches into their sockets and extricates their eyes. Thus
      freed, the dark void behind can see perfectly well in pitch blackness and
      suffer excruciating pain in light (-4 penalty to all rolls). Be careful
      not to lose those eyeballs as re-inserting them is the only way to end the
      Spell.
  - name: Diminish
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Cause something to Test its Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or reduce its size
      by half. Lasts 3 minutes.
  - name: Drown
    cost: 4
    desc: >-
      Cause a target’s lungs to fill with water. They must Test their Luck (or
      Skill for Enemies). If they fail they start to Drown (7.9) and are
      incapacitated as water pours from their mouth. They may Test again once
      per Turn until they pass, at which point the Spell ends.
  - name: Earthquake
    cost: 5
    desc: >-
      The wizard hikes up their wizard robe and stomps their wizard feet. An
      area 30 metres around them suffers a massive earthquake. Everyone must
      Test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or fall through a crack in the
      earth, taking falling Damage and being stuck in a bloody great big hole
      (7.8.1). Buildings may be wrecked unless especially sturdy.
  - name: Ember
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      A simple but effective summoning of fire. Flames the size of a small
      bonfire appear somewhere within 12 metres of the wizard. Once present
      there is no accounting for its actions.
  - name: Exchange Shape
    cost: 5
    desc: >-
      What looks like a hug is in fact fell wizardry! The wizard bumps into
      another and exchanges bodies. Lasts until the wizard chooses to end it but
      they must be within sight of their own body for this to happen.
  - name: Exorcism
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The Red Priests posit that all negative behaviour is a symptom of some
      level of possession, or at least direct influence, by the forces of
      Change, unwitting agents of Mass in need of healing. The wizard throws
      salt at their target and Rolls Versus the possessing spirit to cast it
      out. In the case of a Fumble the spirit is drawn into and possesses the
      wizard.
  - name: Explode
    cost: 5
    desc: >-
      So simple that it’s arguably not even a Spell but rather a premeditated
      failure of catastrophic proportions. The wizard causes a one cubic metre
      object to explode and deal Damage to everyone within 24 metres depending
      on proximity. Those within 6 metres take Damage as a Gigantic Beast,
      within 12 as a Large Beast, 18 as a Modest Beast and 24 as a Small Beast.
  - name: Farseeing
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Endows the wizard with engorged, plate-like eyes that are able to see in
      minute detail for miles around but are unable to see anything up close.
      Lasts until ended.
  - name: Fear
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      In the eyes of one poor target the wizard grows into a primal monster from
      the depths of their lizard brain. They will attempt to flee and if flight
      is impossible they will curl up in a ball and whimper. They may Test their
      Luck (or Skill for Enemies) to resist the illusion.
  - name: Find
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      When wizards lose their glasses they mumble to themselves until they turn
      up. The thing being sought must be a specific object, not a general
      category or type, and the direction is only given in terms of compass
      points.
  - name: Fire Bolt
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      Shoot impressive flames from your fingertips, dealing Damage to one target
      within 20 metres.
  - name: Flash
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      The wizard claps neatly and issues forth the light of a thousand suns from
      their hands. All within 20 metres must Test their Luck (or Skill for
      Enemies) or be blinded for 1d6 minutes.
  - name: Gills
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      The wizard may permanently gift a touched subject with gills, replacing
      their usual breathing arrangement if they fail to Test their Luck (or
      Skill for Enemies). Useful for underwater excursions but less so when
      inflicted upon a chap in the middle of town. The wizard may end this at
      will.
  - name: Grow
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Cause an item to grow half its size again if it fails to Test its Luck (or
      Skill for Enemies). Lasts for 3 minutes.
  - name: Helping Hands
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      Animate hands spring forth from an inanimate surface and perform any task
      the wizard requires but are limited to being rooted to the spot from which
      they sprang. They last until the wizard wills it or leaves the location.
  - name: Hurricane
    cost: 5
    desc: >-
      The wizard waves their hands in the air like they just don’t care, which,
      being wizards, they likely don’t. A mighty gust knocks everyone over
      within 30 metres who fails to Test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies),
      dealing 1d3 Damage and making an awful mess. Lasts for 10 minutes. Test
      Luck every Turn if not taking cover or else take further Damage.
  - name: Illusion
    cost: 2 per viewer
    desc: >-
      Those viewing this illusion may Test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) to
      unveil the trickery. Lasts until the wizard leaves or falls asleep.
  - name: Invisibility
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      The wizard turns flesh into refractive crystal sheets. It’s very
      uncomfortable and you make a slight shish-ing sound as you move but are
      quite invisible and don’t suffer from the usual limitations of illusions.
      Lasts for 3 minutes after which you noisily reform into dull and
      frustratingly opaque flesh.
  - name: Ironhand
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      The common man does not appreciate exactly how close flesh and iron are
      when considered relative to, say, flesh and the smell of hot tea. With
      some slight convincing the wizard may cause a target’s flesh to behave as
      though it had the desirable properties of metal. They get +1 Skill and
      immunity to modestly proportioned fires for 3 minutes.
  - name: Jolt
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The mischievous apprentice’s favourite Spell, Jolt sends an arc of
      electricity from the wizard’s outstretched hand towards a target. Ignores
      Armour.
  - name: Languages
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The wizard forms a mouth with their hands through which they can speak any
      language. They can simultaneously cup their other hand to their ear to
      understand them in return. Lasts for one conversation.
  - name: Leech
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      The necromancer must place their hands on a living subject and allow their
      fingertips to transform into sucking apertures which drain the victim of
      blood. Deal `2d6` Damage to your victim and regain half as much Stamina.
  - name: Levitate
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Elevates the wizard or another on the backs of tiny invisible sprites who
      answer only to their summoner. May float about for 3 minutes.
  - name: Life Line
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      Created by the Horizon Knights to enable them to take the fight to the
      Nothing, they would cast this on their squires and dive off the edge of
      creation. While this Spell lasts the wizard’s essential bodily functions
      are linked to another, thereby enabling them to breath or eat for the
      recipient. They will need to breathe and eat for two, which makes it hard
      to do anything useful while linked. The Spell lasts for a day, until
      cancelled, or until the death of the linked person. Note if the linked
      person dies, starves, or is choked you will suffer equally.
  - name: Light
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      Create an ethereal orb of light that glows like a torch. Lasts 6 hours and
      can be extinguished at will.
  - name: Lock
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      Magically lock an object. The object must have a lockable aspect to it but
      is now magically sealed. Permanent until undone or dismissed.
  - name: Mirror Selves
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      In the minds of others the wizard appears to be, in fact, three wizards.
      All three will perform the same actions in unison, offering attackers only
      a 1 in 3 chance of targeting the right wizard. Lasts for 12 minutes.
  - name: Natter

    desc: >-
      As everyone knows, wizards are excellent ventriloquists, so good, in fact,
      that they can throw their voice inside another’s mouth. They can target
      anyone within sight and transmit a short sentence.
  - name: Open
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The wizard chooses a reality wherein the lock was open all along. May be
      used to open any mundane door or container and counteract a Lock Spell.
  - name: Peace
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Open up the mind to universal love and cause two subjects to Test their
      Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or cease hostilities. They will still defend
      themselves if attacked but will at least appreciate the pettiness of it.
  - name: Poison
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      When cast upon a liquid this Spell causes it to become deadly poison. The
      liquid deals 4 Damage if drunk and 1 Damage per Turn until the target
      successfully Tests their Luck (or Skill for Enemies). The liquid loses its
      potency after an hour.
  - name: Posthumous Vitality
    cost: 5
    desc: >
      Necromancers, known for their social inadequacy, often find themselves
      having to make friends. This Spell requires a fresh, or at least whole and
      lubricated, corpse. The wizard rolls `2d6` plus their Posthumous Vitality
      Skill Total and consults the following chart (13+ counts for an
      Advancement tick): * 4-12 Nothing happens. * 13-14 The vitality is
      clumsily applied, causing the body to explode messily. A new one will need
      to be found. * 15-16 The creature is animated and will last for 24 hours
      before literally falling to pieces. * 17+ Perfect reanimation. The
      creature will last until destroyed.
  - name: Presence
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      This Spell creates the sense of being watched by a patriarchal figure.
      Some find it comforting, others, not so much.
  - name: Protection from Rain
    cost: 1
    desc: This Spell prevents the wizard from getting rained upon for one shower.
  - name: Purple Lens
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The recipient’s eyes glow purple as they experience an alternative reality
      where people are kind, their surroundings are beautiful, their food is
      indulgent, and so on. This doesn’t change the reality of things but it
      does make them more palatable. Lasts until they want it to end.
  - name: Quench
    cost: 1
    desc: Snuff a small flame with the wave of a hand.
  - name: Read Entrails
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The wizard can get the answer to one question from the entrails of a
      living creature. The size and importance of the creature influences the
      level of knowledge gained. Small, common animals are able to offer yes or
      no answers, oxen can predict things obtusely, lamassu may offer explicit
      and thorough advice.
  - name: Read Stars
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      Rather than physical stars the wizard navigates by astral starlight that
      peeks through the veil. This Spell enables the wizard to get a reasonable
      sense of direction regardless of any obscuring factors.
  - name: See Through
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The wizard rubs a surface vigorously, making it translucent. Can penetrate
      up to 12 inches of material. Lead and Silver are immune.
  - name: Sentry
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The wizard plucks a bit of their mind out like candy floss and leaves it
      stuck to a wall somewhere. This psychic presence is invisible to the naked
      eye but extends the wizard’s senses to that spot for the duration. While
      it lasts the wizard suffers -1 to all rolls due to the incredible
      confusion this generates. If the shard is discovered and harmed the wizard
      will lose `2d6` Stamina due to the shock.
  - name: Shatter
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      The wizard may wildly gesticulate at a brittle object no larger than an
      umbrella and cause it to shatter into a million pieces. Living targets may
      Test their Luck to avoid this unpleasant Spell.
  - name: Skeletal Counsel
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      Necromancers often talk to skulls. Sometimes they talk back. Use of this
      Spell enables speaking with the dead, who answer one question per casting.
      Requires a skull.
  - name: Sleep
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      The wizard convinces a target to forgo wakefulness for a time, causing
      them to sleep until woken unless they successfully Test their Luck.
      Remember: fighting is loud.
  - name: Slide Skywards
    cost: 6
    desc: >-
      Requires mirrors or other highly reflective surfaces. The wizard stands
      between two reflective surfaces so that they are infinitely repeated. They
      then step out from between them but as a different incidence of
      themselves. To those watching the wizard moves in the direction not seen
      and reappears between two mirrors elsewhere. If the location has been
      compromised the wizard arrives in a random mirrored location somewhere
      across the million crystal spheres.
  - name: Starry Orb
    cost: 4
    desc: >-
      The wizard creates a 5th dimensional orb above their head. All intelligent
      beings looking at it must Test their Luck or marvel at it for 3 minutes.
  - name: Teleport
    cost: 10
    desc: >-
      The wizard or a target of their choosing may travel to any location within
      a single sphere instantly. If unfamiliar with the location they must Test
      their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or be thrown wildly off course to
      potentially devastating results.
  - name: Thought Vapour
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      The wizard can cause their nose to exist in multiple alternative
      realities, travel through various spheres, and enable the olfactory
      sensation of thought. Emotions, attitudes, and underlying feelings can be
      smelled. No words or images are formed, just impressions. Any strong odour
      will cause this Spell to fail.
  - name: Thunder
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      The wizard raises their arms and shouts something suitably ominous. All
      within 24 metres must Test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or be
      deafened by a riotous roll of thunder. Luck or no, they will be mightily
      impressed.
  - name: Tongue Twister
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Beware! If a wizard screws their nose and twists their fingers at you then
      a Tongue Twister is coming your way. The target must Test their Luck (or
      Skill for Enemies) or have their tongue literally tied in knots. This
      requires some time and a fair bit of patience to disentangle.
  - name: Torpor
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      Those who study the dead consider it necessary to develop a profound
      sympathy with their subject—how can you speak with the dead if you don’t
      understand the dead? Torpor helps build post-mortem empathy by causing the
      necromancer to temporarily die. Bodily functions are halted, no food,
      water, or air is needed, and they are, by most vulgar definitions of the
      word, dead. The Spell lasts until ended by the wizard, who remains vaguely
      aware of their surroundings to the extent of being conscious of sound and
      movement but not of what is said or who is saying it. They will still take
      Damage from bodily abuse while under the effect and can indeed become
      irretrievably dead.
  - name: True Seeing
    cost: 3
    desc: >-
      The wizard focuses their sight on the unambiguous truth of matter,
      enabling them to see through illusions for the next 10 minutes.
  - name: Undo
    cost: _double cost of original Spell_
    desc: >-
      The wizard disentangles a Spell from this instance of reality. To do so
      they must Roll Versus the original casting if disentanglement is possible
      at all.
  - name: Ward
    cost: 1
    desc: >-
      A handy Spell only requiring the flick of a wrist. In response to being
      fired upon the wizard may cast this Spell to cause the missile to be
      deflected.
  - name: Wall of Power
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      What they call a wall is in fact a dome, but wizards always have worked in
      mysterious ways. The wall is a shimmering bubble that causes 1d6 Damage
      when touched. Nothing may pass without the wizard’s permission (it is
      recommended that they remember to allow air). Lasts for 12 minutes.
  - name: Web
    cost: 2
    desc: >-
      Whether this is opening a portal to the plane of slime or channelling the
      sprites of sickness, all can agree that it is quite disgusting. The wizard
      blows forth the “web” from their nose and all in a cone extending 12
      metres in front of the wizard are trapped unless they Test their Luck (or
      Skill for Enemies). Each Turn anything passing through or out of it must
      repeat the Test or become stuck. Dries up after 12 rounds.
  - name: Zed
    cost: null
    'null': null
    desc: >-
      No one knows what this does but everyone who has cast it disappears
      instantly, never to be seen again.
