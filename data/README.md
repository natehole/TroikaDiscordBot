# Data Directory

This is where you can put compendiums and load them from the bot. Note that by
default only the troika.yml file is loaded, since that represents the base
rules. But you can add other background files and it can use them instead of the
main backgrounds potentially. Since those backgrounds may have been produced by
outside creators, do NOT add them to the Github repo.
